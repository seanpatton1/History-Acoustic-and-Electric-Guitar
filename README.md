## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

* The website's landing page design embodies a minimalist aesthetic, featuring clickable images representing both acoustic and electric guitars, creating an intuitive user interface for navigation.

* Both the acoustic and electric pages delve into the instrument's historical background, featuring demonstrations of musicians playing them along with brief biographical information about each artist.

* Offers the user a concise description of the instrument without overwhelming them with excessive information.

* Provides the option to subscribe to a newsletter regarding the instruments, offering updates on any new information or developments related to both.

### User Stories

* As a customer, I want to delve into the website's content, aiming to uncover information about both acoustic and electric guitars through navigation.

* As a customer, I want a succinct introduction to the instruments as a starting point before I determine if I want to delve deeper into learning more about them.

* As a customer, I want to have the option to access more information on the subject if I choose to learn more.

* As a customer, I want to see examples of the instruments' sound to gain a better understanding of their professional playing style.

* As a customer, I want to locate social media links to external sources of information beyond the website.

### Color Scheme
![palette image](assets/readme-files/colour%20palette.png)

The colours used on this website are variations of black (#3a3a3a and #000000) and white (#ffffff) which are used consistently throughout the website. The contrast comes from the video and images throughout the site. 


### Typography

I've chosen to implement the Ozwald font across the website, varying its textures and sizes as needed. The headings and navigation links feature a bolder variant of the font, while the main content on both the acoustic and electric pages adopts a lighter styling. In case the selected font fails to load, a sans-serif font serves as a backup.

### Basic Design

I opted to sketch my design ideas for the website using pen and paper. This method of testing proved invaluable in helping me visualize my vision, especially considering this is my inaugural project. There were several iterations of the design before settling on the current one implemented on the website.

### Code

- For the iframe videos on both acoustic and electric I referred to a YouTube video [Alan Simpson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whe7kKahkk&ab_channel=AlanSimpson) to create the responsivness as the screen got larger - using height: calc(.5625* 80vw); - and moving this along with the calculation which works out aspect ratio as the screen gets larger.

- I reffered to the love running project when styling my header and nav links using the code and editing to suit the project

- I reffered to the love running project for the form and then edited where required. Basic structure of form used and removed code not required.

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) were used throughout the creation of this project.
