## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

* The website's landing page design embodies a minimalist aesthetic, featuring clickable images representing both acoustic and electric guitars, creating an intuitive user interface for navigation.

* Both the acoustic and electric pages delve into the instrument's historical background, featuring demonstrations of musicians playing them along with brief biographical information about each artist.

* Offers the user a concise description of the instrument without overwhelming them with excessive information.

* Provides the option to subscribe to a newsletter regarding the instruments, offering updates on any new information or developments related to both.

### User Stories

* As a customer, I want to delve into the website's content, aiming to uncover information about both acoustic and electric guitars through navigation.

* As a customer, I want a succinct introduction to the instruments as a starting point before I determine if I want to delve deeper into learning more about them.

* As a customer, I want to have the option to access more information on the subject if I choose to learn more.

* As a customer, I want to see examples of the instruments' sound to gain a better understanding of their professional playing style.

* As a customer, I want to locate social media links to external sources of information beyond the website.

### Color Scheme
![palette image](assets/readme-files/colour-palette.png)

The website employs consistent variations of black (#3a3a3a and #000000) and white (#ffffff) hues across its design, with contrast provided by the inclusion of videos and images throughout the site. 


### Typography

I've opted to utilize the Ozwald font throughout the website, adjusting its textures and sizes as required. Heading titles and navigation links showcase a more robust iteration of the font, whereas the primary content on both the acoustic and electric pages adopts a lighter appearance. Should the chosen font encounter loading issues, a sans-serif font acts as a fallback option.

### Basic Design

I opted to sketch my design ideas for the website using pen and paper. This method of testing proved invaluable in helping me visualize my vision, especially considering this is my inaugural project. There were several iterations of the design before settling on the current one implemented on the website.

### Code

- For the iframe videos on both acoustic and electric I referred to a YouTube video [Alan Simpson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_whe7kKahkk&ab_channel=AlanSimpson) to create the responsivness as the screen got larger - using height: calc(.5625* 80vw); - and moving this along with the calculation which works out aspect ratio as the screen gets larger.

- I referred to the love running project when styling my header and nav links using the code and editing to suit the project

- I referred to the love running project for the form and then edited where required. Basic structure of form used and removed code not required.

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) were used throughout the creation of this project.
